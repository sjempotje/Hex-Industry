guide.page.0 = Hex Industry Guide\nBy [#4B93D5]@The Serjio#3162[] and [#0096FF]xzxADIxzx#7729[]
guide.page.1 = Buttons System\nButtons are used to open hexes and build. They always write how much it costs to click on it and what it gives in return: [green]green[] numbers display what it will give to you and [red]red[] numbers display cost.\nAfter the start, you should see your citadel - a hex with your core. Next to it there is a button "Open Hex" - pressing it will cost you at least 1 unit.
guide.page.2 = Resource System\nNothing is free. You have resources displayed at the top -  titanium,  thorium,  plastanium,  spores,  units,  crawlers and some liquids. Building something requires resources, but in return it produces others. Some buildings require liquid, and if you don`t have this liquid, the building will explode.
guide.page.3 = Range System\nYou can't build anywhere, you need a hex to be in your area of effect to do so. Base hexes and citadels extend this area by 3 hexes around them, so these hexes are the main target in PvP.
guide.page.4 = Health System\nAll hexes have health points - you can see them at top label near resources, and they are also displayed as flashing circle of particles at hex. You can heal your hex by double-clicking on it, but it costs 500  titanium and requires arkycite.
guide.page.5 = Attack System\nYou can attack enemy hexes by double clicking on them. After that, it will be on cooldown and covered in smoke. While the hex is on cooldown, it cannot be attacked or upgraded, but it can be healed.
guide.page.6 = Tips\nFirst of all, you must get  titanium. Open hexes until you find a hex with  titanium ore and build a miner on it. After mining titanium, mine thorium, build an oil pump, get plastanium and etc.
guide.page.7 = Tips\nThere are 4 liquids - oil, water, cryofluid  and arkycite. They cannot be spent - once you build a pump, you will have a liquid until the pump is destroyed. Oil is needed for plastanium, water is needed for cultivators, cryofluid for maze shops and arcycite for healing hexes. Water and cryofluid speed up production by 10% and 20%.
guide.page.8 = Tips\nMono cities gives you units once when built, it doesn't produce them like a miner. In Maze shops, you can buy different things that give you crawlers, units, or technologies. Read their description carefully: it contains a lot of useful information.
guide.page.9 = Good luck, have fun!
