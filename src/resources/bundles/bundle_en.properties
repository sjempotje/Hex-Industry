guide.name = Guid Page {0}
guide.next = Next
guide.prev = Previous
guide.exit = Exit

guide.page.0 = Hex Industry Guide\nBy [#4B93D5]@The Serjio#3162
guide.page.1 = Here, you should see your citadel - a hex with your core. There also are buttons "Open Hex" near your hex(es) - click them to reveal those black hexes
guide.page.2 = But those actions are not for free - nothing is free. You have resources (displayed at top) -  people,  crawlers,  titanium,  thorium,  plastanium,  spore-pods and all liquids except  slag. Opening hexes only charges  people.
guide.page.3 = At opened hexes, you will see label-button(s), 1 or 2 at hex. They describe what will be build if you click them, [green]green[] numbers display what it will give to you, and [red]red[] numbers display cost of this building. You can only build buildings that you have enough resources for (i hope its obvious).
guide.page.4 = First of all, you should get  titanium. Reveal hexes until you meet a hex with titanium  ore - and build a miner on it. You should build at least 3 titanium miners for stable economics.\nAfter getting titanium, you should mine  thorium - same as titanium.
guide.page.5 = There are 3 liquids -  water,  cryofluid and  oil.\nThey cannot be spent - once you build a pump, you will have a liquid until pump is destroyed.\nWater is needed for cultivators, oil is needed for plastanium, and cryofluid for maze shops.\nWater and cryofluid speeds up your production by 10% and 20%.
guide.page.6 = Mono City gives you people once when built, it does not produce them like miner.\nIn Maze shop, You can buy different things that give you crawlers, people or technologies (read their description carefully).
guide.page.7 = All hexes have Health Points - you can see them at top-label near resources, and HP is also displayed as flashing circle of particles at hex.\nYou can attack hex with enemy structure by clicking on it - then, select weapon from weapon list which you have enough resources for, and something should happen. Some weapons can be opened in maze shop.\nAfter hex is attacked (and/or destroyed), it will be in cooldown and covered by smoke.\nYou can`t build on or attack a hex while it is in cooldown.
guide.page.8 = Good luck, have fun!
